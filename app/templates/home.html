    <h2>Predict the Rarity (Rank) of a Hypothetical Monster</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this project is to predict the rarity of a hypothetical monster with a confidence level based on its stats 
        such as level, health, energy, and sanity. The monster is randomly generated from a Python library. 
        You can view the list of monsters by clicking the DATA tab. Visualization of the data with user interaction is 
        displayed under the VIEW tab. Finally, the MODEL tab will show you the prediction of the rarity based on the numbers 
        you enter in the fields. Have fun! </p>
